# The Books Project

The Books Project is an app that serves as a guide to some of the most famous books and authors from classic to contemporary times.

## Developer's Goals

This project is developed for educational purposes. I am creating this project using React for frontend and Django for backend. Having studied Django earlier this year, and finishing a comprehensive course on React this autumn, starting developing a personal project involving two of my favourite technologies - the aforementioned ones - was a no brainer.

# Project Goals

This website has been created in order to help inspire users to select their next book or author to read. Apart from various types of filtering through the books and authors, the user has the capability to create their own list of favourite books and authors. This can be easily achieved by enabling the user to create their own account. Upon creating the account, a profile section will be created automatically.
