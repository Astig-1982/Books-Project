# The Books Project

The Books Project is website that serves as a guide to some of the most famous books and authors from classic to contemporary times.

## Developer's Goals

This project is developed for educational purposes. I am creating this project using React for frontend and Django for backend. Having studied Django earlier this year, and finishing a comprehensive course on React this autumn, starting developing a personal project involving two of my favourite technologies - the aforementioned ones - was a no brainer.

## Project Goals

This website has been created in order to help inspire users to select their next book or author to read. Apart from various types of filtering through the books and authors, the user has the capability to create their own list of favourite books and authors. This can be easily achieved by enabling the user to create their own account. Upon creating the account, a profile section will be created automatically.

## User Stories

* As a user I would like to have easy access to a list of randomly ordered various books.
* As a user I would like to have easy access to a list of randomly ordered various authors.

* As a user I would like to be able to filter the authors based on the period in which they published their work.
* As a user I would like to be able to filter the authors based on the fact if they are or not still alive.
* As a user I would like to filter the authors based on their nationality.
* As a user I would like to be able to add my favourite books and authors to a private section so I can always refer to them anytime.
* As a user I would like to have my own profile page.
